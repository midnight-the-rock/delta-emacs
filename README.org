#+Title: Emacs configurations
#+Author: midnight-the-rock

Emacs, the extensible, open source, elisp driven operating system that lacks a proper text editor.

These are my personal configurations, nothing here is guaranteed to work for you. That said, use it as you please.

You can generate the whole configuration with src_sh{init.org} and the custom colorscheme with src_sh{theme.org}.
